How to run?

First of all you need to have a JRE at least 11 version.

Secondly, you need to download source code from origin/develop.

Use the following commands depending on your operating system:
 - Windows - gradlew.bat build bootRun
 - Linux - sh gradlew build bootRun

Or via using IDE instruments.
